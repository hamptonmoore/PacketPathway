# PacketPathway

A simple tool for visualizing network packets and the choices made as they move across a network.

## Disclaimer
The point of PacketPathway is not to create a 1:1 mapping of packets and how they work, some of the representations are not accurate. The point is to give a general idea of how packets move across a network and the choices made along the way. Simplifications are made to make the tool easier to use, understand, and develop.
